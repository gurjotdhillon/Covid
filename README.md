# Covid
## Introduction
In this project, I analyzed covid19 data from year 2020. COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus that was first detected in late 2019. COVID-19 can affect the respiratory system and cause symptoms such as fever, cough, shortness of breath, and loss of taste or smell. 
### About Data
The data was collected from ‘Our World in Data’ as a csv file. The file was then divided into 2 separate files- Covid Deaths and Covid Vaccinations, to improve the quality of analysis. Both the tables share columns like location, continent, date and then contain individual columns related to deaths, testing and vaccination

### Files:
  - Theres a sql file with all the code.
  - I prepared a report to summarize my findings.
  - I prepared a presentation to visualize my research.
